#### Exploring growth dynamics and critical phenomena in the agential decision-making behaviors of Physarum polycephalum
We investigate the growth dynamics and agential decision-making behaviors of Physarum polycephalum, a single-celled, multinucleate slime mold known for its remarkable problem-solving capabilities, despite lacking neuronal connections. Employing graph-theoretic methods with a special focus on edges connecting nodes (vertices), we analyze variations in network features across diverse biological strains and quantify parameters relative to the organism's age (from sclerotia revival) and nutrient availability. Our exploration of the hierarchical network of tubular veins within Physarum polycephalum aims to unveil the mechanisms underpinning its information-processing capabilities. Additionally, we investigate mass sensing, morphological changes related to the area and perimeter of the organismic growth, and energy flow within the network to elucidate thermodynamic optimization principles, facilitating the analysis of how network structures at different scales of self-organization evolve in the course of hours for efficient energy and information transfer. Furthermore, our inquiry investigates critical phenomena in these network dynamics, with a focus on phase transitions and emergent critical behavior. This research enriches our understanding of the physical principles governing the emergence of complexity in aneural biological systems operating far from thermal equilibrium.

#### Exploring Efficiency Dynamics in Quantum Otto Engines under Negative Temperature Conditions
Recent studies show classical and quantum thermal machines operate more efficiently with quasi-static strokes and in environments with negative temperatures. Surprisingly, quantum Otto engines at negative temperatures demonstrate increased efficiency with faster cycles. We investigate this counterintuitive behavior, attributing it to entropy production and friction effects unique to negative temperature environments.

#### Equilibration of objective observables in a dynamical model of quantum measurements
The challenge of understanding quantum measurement persists as a fundamental issue in modern physics. Particularly, the abrupt and energy-non-conserving collapse of the wave function appears to contradict classical thermodynamic laws. The contradiction can be resolved by considering measurement itself to be an entropy-increasing process, driven by the second law of thermodynamics. A recent proposal on this theme, dubbed the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis, builds on the Quantum Darwinism framework derived to explain the emergence of the classical world, asserting that measurement outcomes emerge objectively from unitary dynamics via closed-system equilibration. In this talk, I will introduce the set of objectifying observables that best objectively encode the measurement statistics of a system in this hypothesis. I will also show results quantifying the probability that an observer will obtain an incorrect measurement outcome, and that objectifying observables readily equilibrate on average for a reasonable class of Hamiltonians. Numerical results will also be presented showing that the error only approaches zero with increasing environment size when the environment is coarse-grained into so-called observer systems, suggesting that coarse-graining is required for the emergence of objectivity.

#### Collision models from the perspective of scattering events
A collision model is a blueprint for  generic opensystems in which the environment is modeled as a sequence of ancillas unitarily interacting with the system. It can be viewed as a mathematical idealization of scattering processes in which kinetics are reduced to a mere swichting on and off of the interaction. Such models are capable of describing thermalization processes if one restricts to energy preserving interaction terms, but the link to dynamical scattering models with both internal and motional degrees of freedom remains to be explored. Recently this link has been investigated in a one-dimensional setting [1,2]. 
Here we consider two and three-dimensional scenarios and study under which conditions they can be described by collision models, once the motional degrees of freedom are averaged out. Specifically, we focus on (non-relativistic) high energy scattering and the energy exchange between internal and kinetic energy. We identify the parameter regimes and interaction types that lead to Gibbsian or non-Gibbsian equilibrium state of the internal degrees of freedom.

#### Thermodynamics of photodevices
We study the thermodynamics of a molecular junction in the presence of electron repulsion, where sunlight plays the role of the hot bath. By tuning the asymmetry of the junction, we first show that our device can operate either as a photoconductor or as a solar cell, whose efficiency is captured with a single coefficient of performance. We then show that when the electron repulsion energy is tuned to the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that electron repulsion is beneficial in the solar cell if electron repulsion energy is smaller than the transport gap. Our work sheds light on principles for designing efficient photodevices.

#### Exploring the role of weak measurements in dissipative quantum systems
A quantum weak measurement is a four-step procedure that involves a target system and an ancillary meter [1]. In the initial phase, pre-selection occurs, necessitating the careful choice of the system’s initial state. Proceeding to the second step, a weak interaction occurs via a unitary operator that entangles both the ancillary meter and the system of interest. The third step encompasses a post-selection procedure applied to the system, including a projective measurement process along with subsequent filtration. Eventually, the meter wave function is readout. The meter wavefunction exhibits two shifts. In the position representation, the shift is proportional to the real component of the weak value Aw = ⟨ψf | ˆA|ψi⟩/⟨ψf |ψi⟩ . In contrast, the shift observed in the momentum representation holds a proportionality to the imaginary part of the weak value.

In practice, genuine isolation of quantum systems remains an unattainable ideal. Under certain approximations, the evolution of the system’s dynamics can be effectively characterized by a Markovian master equation. This equation comprises a primary term derived from the von Neumann equation, governing the evolution of density matrices. The second term is the application of the dissipator to the density operator, which presides over the dissipative dynamics of the system, involving dissipation, decoherence, and dephasing. This term is proportional to the dissipation rates. We investigate weak measurements accompanied by dissipation, specifically exploring scenarios where dissipation takes place subsequent to the weak interaction but before the post-selection stage [2]. Notably, this scheme is present in any experimental setup with a time delay between the unitary interaction and the post-selection. We assume a short duration of the weak interaction to neglect concurrent dissipation.

We explore the interplay between dissipation and weak values when the dissipation time approaches infinity. For non-degenerate systems, as this dissipation time increases, the distinctive characteristics of the weak value disappear gradually as it converges towards the operator’s expectation value. In the case of degenerate steady state systems, a contrasting phenomenon emerges : anomalous weak values can persist even as the dissipation time extends infinitely.

Weak values can also be used at short times to extract information about the dissipative dynamics of the system, notably to differentiate non-Markovian from Markovian dynamics. Our theoretical framework allows us to glean insights into dissipative processes occurring over short time of dissipation and featuring low dissipation rates. It is useful to determine if dissipation is relevant in experiments.

We exemplify the model by using a two-level atom as the quantum system of interest, and a single-photon cavity field serving as the meter. The weak measurement is obtained through the short passage of the atom by the cavity. Subsequently, the atom suffers dissipation, by interacting with a quantized radiation field. The radiation field is composed by a reservoir with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. After post-selection, the real and imaginary parts of the weak value are measured by reading out the quadratures of the cavity field. Interestingly, dissipation rates are observed through the ancillary state across varying durations of dissipation with increased sensitivity. When considering a non-Markovian dissipation, under certain circumstances, this type of dissipation can be differentiated from a Markovian one, exploiting weak-value amplification.

#### Quantum unital Otto heat engines: Universal bounds
In the last few decades, with the hope of building quantum computers, a quantum theory of thermodynamics has become a necessity. Quantum computers need to be fueled with systems in highly pure states. To generate these states, one needs to cool quantum systems to very low temperatures. The process of cooling is a thermodynamic process, hence the need for quantum thermodynamics [1]. Furthermore, to my best understanding, quantum computers also need quantum engines, quantum batteries, and quantum clocks. For example, when one wants to do a computation, one will implement a series of unitary gates. These operations need a source of energy, which could be, e.g., a quantum battery. On the other hand, these unitary gates also need good clocks to be implemented with high accuracy. These examples show the importance of this field.


In this poster presentation, I'm going to focus on and present my results on a special type of quantum heat engine called \textit{quantum unital Otto heat engines}, see Ref. [2]. An example of this engine is when we replace the hot heat bath of the Otto cycle with quantum projective measurement [3,4,5]. I consider a working medium to be an arbitrary qubit. This engine has the property that when there is no monitoring of the working medium, coherence can contribute to heat and work. However, when the system is monitored, in this case, coherence in the energy basis is killed. When the quantum coherence is not erased, I call the engine the \textit{undephased engine}. On the other hand, when this is not the case I call the engine \textit{dephased engine}. 
	
For the dephased engine, I show that in the heat engine region, the ratio of work and heat fluctuations is not arbitrary but can be lower and upper-bounded [2,6,7]. The upper bound is unity, and the lower bound is the square of the efficiency of the engine. Furthermore, I also show that the relative fluctuations of work and heat satisfy a hierarchy relationship. These results are shown to hold independently of whether the cycle is time-reversal symmetric or not. The latter refers to the fact that the unitaries characterizing the adiabatic strokes, i.e., $U$ and $V$, need not satisfy $V=U^{\dagger}$.




When we replace the hot heat bath with, e.g., a quantum projective measurement, there are two random quantities that describe the heat released to the cold bath, denoted $Q_{C}$ and $Q_{C}'$. $Q_{C}$($Q_{C}'$) follow from four(five)-point measurements [4,7]. I show that using $Q_{C}$ is better than $Q_{C}'$, either from a computational or physical point of view [8]. This is because $Q_{C}$ needs fewer measurements and satisfies energy conservation not only at the average level but also at the trajectory level. Further, I show that the relative fluctuations of $Q_{C}$ provide a lower bound to the relative fluctuations of the stochastic work $(W)$ and the stochastic heat absorbed $(Q_{M})$. The relative fluctuations of $Q_{C}$ themselves obey a thermodynamic uncertainty relation [9], developed in [10].



When the engine is not monitored, I find that to maintain coherence, one should use Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-probability [11,12,13]. The latter satisfies all the Kolmogorov axioms, except that it can be negative and even a complex number. I give the general expression of the first two cumulants of the thermodynamic quantities for arbitrary unitaries characterizing the adiabatic strokes and arbitrary unital channels [14]. My detailed study gives a comparison between the dephased and undephased engines. The study revealed that when coherence is not erased, the system can work as a heat engine even in the usually-not-allowed regime. My work shows that non-adiabatic transitions are not always harmful and that they can be used advantageously. Furthermore, I show an upper bound on work reliability either for the dephased or undephased engine. My study, I believe, would be important to quantum engines and refrigerators fueled by quantum measurement.

#### Quantum Thermodynamic Speed Limit
We generalize the information processing scheme of the classical autonomous Hamiltonian 
system studied in [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] into the quantum scheme. We derived 
the corresponding quantum Landauer’s principle and relate the effective quantum speed 
limit with respect to the composite system of the system and memory, which we call 
quantum thermodynamic speed limit, to the Landauer’s bound. We also demonstrate the 
relation between the quantum thermodynamic speed limit with the quantum hypothesis

#### Unveiling Detuning Effects for Heat-Current Control in Quantum Thermal Devices
Navigating the intricacies of thermal management at the quantum scale is a challenge in the pursuit of advanced nanoscale technologies. To this extent, theoretical frameworks introducing minimal models mirroring the functionality of electronic current amplifiers and transistors, for instance, have been proposed. Different architectures of the subsystems composing a quantum thermal device can be considered, tacitly bringing drawbacks or advantages if properly engineered.This paper extends the prior research on thermotronics, studying a strongly coupled three-subsystem thermal device with a specific emphasis on a third excited level in the control subsystem. Our setup can be employed as a multipurpose device conditioned on the specific choice of internal parameters: heat switch, rectifier, stabilizer, and amplifier. The exploration of the detuned levels unveils a key role in the performance and working regime of the device. We observe a stable and strong amplification effect persisting over broad ranges of temperature. We conclude that considering a three-level system, as the one directly in contact with the control temperature, boosts output currents and the ability to operate our devices as a switch at various temperatures.

#### Physical Advantage and Limitation of Quantum Generative Models
The main objective of the generative models is to train the generator to produce data with high accuracy and substantial diversity from a vast amount of unlabeled data, which are associated with the quality. While the quantum generative models are expected to outperform their classical counterparts, a comprehensive understanding of their physical advantage and limitation with respect to the quality has remained an open problem. We propose a quality measure called quantum inception score, which can be defined by using Holevo information. This allows us to connect the quality of the quantum generative models to the classical capacity of the quantum channels. Also, the proposed metric leads us to demonstrate that the advantage in the quality is attributed to the presence of the quantum coherences, and further that entanglement significantly enables further enhancement of the quality. Finally, we employ the fluctuation theorem approach to demonstrate that the decoherence is the primary reason for the quality degradation.

#### Enantiomer detection via quantum Otto cycle
Enantiomers are chiral molecules that exist in right-handed and left-handed conformations. Optical techniques of enantiomers' detection are widely employed to discriminate between left- and right-handed molecules. However, identical spectra of enantiomers make enantiomer detection a very challenging task. Here, we investigate the possibility of exploiting thermodynamic processes for enantiomer detection. In particular, we employ a quantum Otto cycle in which a chiral molecule described by a three-level system with cyclic optical transitions is considered a working medium. Each energy transition of the three-level system is coupled with an external laser drive. We find that the left- and right-handed enantiomers operate as a quantum heat engine and a thermal accelerator, respectively, when the overall phase is the control parameter. In addition, both enantiomers act as heat engines by keeping the overall phase constant and using the laser drives' detuning as the control parameter during the cycle. However, the molecules can still be distinguished because both cases' extracted work and efficiency are quantitatively very different. Accordingly, the left- and right-handed molecules can be distinguished by evaluating the work distribution in the Otto cycle.

#### We can catalyse it for you thermally: Catalytic transformations for thermal operations
What are the fundamental limits and advantages of using a catalyst to aid thermodynamic transformations between quantum systems? In this work, we answer this question by focusing on transformations between energy-incoherent states under the most general energy-conserving interactions among the system, the catalyst, and a thermal environment. The sole constraint is that the catalyst must return unperturbed and uncorrelated with the other subsystems. More precisely, we first characterise the set of states to which a given initial state can thermodynamically evolve (the catalysable future) or from which it can evolve (the catalysable past) with the help of a strict catalyst. Secondly, we derive lower bounds on the dimensionality required for the existence of catalysts under thermal process, along with bounds on the catalyst’s state preparation. Finally, we quantify the catalytic advantage in terms of the volume of the catalysable future and demonstrate its utility in an exemplary task of generating entanglement using thermal resources.

#### The Complexity of Determining whether Finite Sized Systems Thermalize
The question of whether a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in modern condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are.
    Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer.
    In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which determining thermalization is as hard as a PSPACE-complete problem.
    Our results build off recent work [Shiraishi & Matsumoto, Nature Communications, 12, 5084 (2021)] demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, and shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.

#### Nonuniform level scaling in quantum heat engines
Size-invariant shape transformation is a technique of changing the shape of a potential by preserving the Lebesgue measure. Such transformations to quantum systems cause the energy levels of the working substance to scale nonuniformly and alter the thermodynamic properties of few-level systems in a non-classical way. In quantum heat engines, the working substance is usually a few-level quantum system. For such systems, the nonuniform level scaling unleashes some unusual thermodynamic behaviors, e.g. spontaneous transitions into lower entropy states and cooling (heating) by effective compression (expansion), which are impossible in classical systems. Here, we investigate this new type of operation in quantum heat engines, which opens a new degree of freedom in controlling quantum thermal machines. We first explain the underlying physical reason for such behaviors by examining the effects of size-invariant modifications on the energy level structure of the quantum substance in detail. In particular, a geometry-induced eigenstate swapping occurs due to the shrinkage of the eigenstates leading to an excessive occupation of the ground-state, while the that of excited states decrease. This causes a competition between the ground state and thermal contributions to the thermodynamic properties. We also identify avoided crossing effects in the spectra that are important in determining the nature of the transitions. Furthermore, we discuss the quantum Stirling and Otto cycle variants under isoformal (size- and shape-preserving) process, along with the role of quantum coherence. The effect we discuss here is so general that it could be realized in any finite-level quantum system (even in a qubit) undergoing a size-preserving transformation.

#### The Stochastic Thermodynamics of Aging
High school biology traditionally attributes aging to DNA mutation, resulting in cellular dysfunction during self-replication. A novel perspective now arises, emphasizing the statistical interpretation of cell mutation. Healthy cells exhibit low entropy and high energy production, indicative of order. Conversely, mutating cells experience reduced efficiency, lower energy production, and increased entropy. Upon cell death, entropy reaches its maximum. The probabilistic nature of DNA prompts a shift toward understanding aging through statistical thermodynamics, enabling the formulation of a mathematical model. This research delves into the thermodynamics of biological processes, framing macroscopic aging as entropy's function.
The focus is on a three-state mechanical model akin to Maxwell's demon, which reaches a periodic steady state with an incoming bitstream over time. The research introduces a time-dependent modification to the rotation rate of the demon, gradually decreasing until the demon's  ability to transcribe information becomes too inefficient, mimicking system 'death' analogous to cell demise. Solving the master equation analytically reveals a monotonically increasing entropy over time. This study bears significant implications, suggesting living systems operate statistically, allowing for the construction of probabilistic models to quantify their behavior.

#### Catalytic enhancement in the performance of the microscopic two-stroke heat engine
We consider a model of a heat engine operating in the microscopic regime: the two-stroke engine. It produces work and exchanges heat in two discrete strokes that are separated in time. The engine consists of two d-level systems initialized in thermal states at two distinct temperatures. Additionally, an auxiliary non-equilibrium system called catalyst may be incorporated into the engine, provided the state of the catalyst remains unchanged after the completion of a thermodynamic cycle. This ensures that the work produced arises solely from the temperature difference. Upon establishing the rigorous thermodynamic framework, we characterize two-fold improvement stemming from the inclusion of a catalyst. Firstly, we show that the presence of a catalyst allows for surpassing the optimal efficiency of two-stroke heat engines which are not assisted by a catalyst. In particular, we prove that the optimal efficiency for two-stroke heat engine consisting of two-level systems is given
by the Otto efficiency, and that it can be surpassed via incorporating a catalyst. Secondly, we show that incorporating a catalyst allows the engine to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are not accessible for non-catalytic two-stroke engines. Finally I would like to explain how this model of the engine can be realized via an autonomous heat engine.

#### Quantum Channel Classification by Quantum Fluctuation Theorem
Quantum channel classification constitutes a significant task to explore the dynamics of quantum systems and design protocols for robust quantum information processing. Quantum processes are categorized into three distinct classes: unitary, non-unitary but unital, and non-unital evolution. In this study, we illustrate how the quantum fluctuation theorem, applied within the framework of open quantum systems utilizing the one-time measurement scheme, facilitates the differentiation of these processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the heat conditioned upon the initial energy measurement of the system, termed conditional heat, serves as the metric for quantum channel classification. We establish three conditions that the conditional heat must satisfy for the system to undergo any of these evolutions. Moreover, we provide an operational significance to the conditional heat by associating it with quantum hypothesis testing.

#### Symmetry shapes thermodynamics of macroscopic quantum systems
Symmetries play a fundamental role in shaping physical theories, from quantum mechanics to thermodynamics. Studying the entropic, energetic, or dynamic signatures of underlying symmetries in quantum systems is an active field of research, from fundamental questions about entropy scalings, ground state properties, or thermalization, to the optimization of quantum computing or numerical simulation procedures, and is gaining momentum due to
rapid experimental advances, particularly in cold atoms [1].

In this work [2], we derive a systematic approach to the thermodynamics of quantum systems based on the underlying symmetry groups. We show that the entropy of a system can be described in terms of group-theoretical quantities that are largely independent of the details of its density matrix. We apply our technique to generic N identical interacting d-level quantum systems. Using permutation invariance, we find that, for large N , the entropy displays a universal large deviation behavior with a rate function s(x) that is completely independent of the microscopic details of the model, but depends only on the size of the irreducible representations of the permutation group. In turn, the partition function is shown to satisfy a large deviation principle with a free energy f (x) = e(x) − s(x)/β, where e(x) is a rate function that only depends on the ground state energy of particular subspaces determined by group representation theory. We demonstrate the power of our approach by
applying it to the nontrivial task of describing phase transitions governed by the interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in the transverse-field Curie-Weiss model.

#### Performance of Simon's algorithm in the NISQ era
Simon’s algorithm was one of the first to demonstrate a divergence in complexity between the quantum and classical computational paradigms. The algorithm, however, assumes access to noise-free qubits—a dream which has not yet been realized. In our work we use Simon’s algorithm to benchmark the error rates of devices currently available in the quantum cloud. As a main result we obtain an objective comparison between the different physical platforms. It is observed that the error scales linearly on IonQ trapped ion computers, while IBM superconducting computers experience a superlinear jump in error at the 8-12 qubit range. However, all computers show significant error (≥ 25%) at large scales. This indicates the extent of improvement needed in quantum hardware and error mitigation before algorithms like Simon's can be run with advantage at large scales.

#### Equilibration time for random Hamiltonians
Equilibration in closed quantum systems has gained significant attention in the last decade, unveiling several emerging thermodynamical properties. Based on a minimal set of assumption, such as unitary evolution and time-averaging, a system equilibrates if it behaves as if it were described by a statistical ensemble that maximise its entropy [1]. Despite several results having been established, a major open question regards the time scales at which this equilibration occurs [2]. In this work, we delve into the equilibration time for systems that can be described by random matrix Hamiltonians, which prove to be useful in describing certain statistical properties of quantum chaotic systems [3]. This approach is rooted in the spirit of statistical physics, where we replace complexity with classical randomness and thus we avoid system-specific features of a particular Hamiltonians. We study how the average equilibration time depends on the parameter of the random matrix ensemble, showing that this depends only on a few parameters of the original ensemble. In statistical physics, fluctuations are extremely relevant: hence, we also assess how much the equilibration time fluctuates, revealing dependencies on parameters distinct from those affecting the average equilibration time. Furthermore, we explore the impact of coarse-graining, both in terms of energy level coarse-graining and macro-fractionation of multipartite systems. Finally, as an application, we investigate the equilibration time scales in the emergence of objectivity according to the recently proposed Measurement Equilibration Hypothesis (MEH) [4].

#### The role of conservation laws on process statistics
In quantum thermodynamics, the statistical predictions of two-time quantities (TTQs), like variation of energy, work, and heat, is crucial for understanding thermodynamic fluctuations. However, measuring and statistically analyzing these process-dependent TTQs in quantum systems poses unique challenges: not only does the measurement disturb these quantities, but also traditional quantum measurements, focused on instantaneous values, do not encompass quantities that depend on an interval of time. To describe TTQ measurements, many protocols were presented in the literature, including the two-point measurement, full-counting statistics, and two-time Heisenberg observables. However, since these forms of defining TTQs statistics and measuring them generally give different predictions and lab results, one might still ask which results are correct and with which laws they are consistent. Our study takes into account these challenges by first proposing criteria for the ideal statistical characterization of TTQs, proposing that they must (i) be state-independent, (ii) adhere to conservation laws, and (iii) satisfy a 'reality condition' ensuring known quantities at interval endpoints yield accurate differences. Considering these criteria, we reveal instances where we show that only one protocol can describe TTQs statistics satisfying simultaneously all criteria (i)-(iii): the two-time Heisenberg observables. Finally, we explicitly validate our theory with two compelling examples: a trapped ion platform and a two-qubit system.

#### Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for strong system-environment coupling
Classical Markovian thermodynamical processes obey a trade-off relationship between current fluctuations and energy dissipation, encapsulated by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). Recent advancements in quantum thermodynamics reveal a departure from this classical constraint, offering a 'precision advantage' wherein current fluctuations can be minimized while maintaining energy dissipation. Our study investigates the influence of strong interaction between a quantum system and its environment on the TUR and seeks to enhance the 'quantum precision advantage'. We employ the reaction-coordinate mapping method to incorporate the effects of strong system-environment coupling. Our results for a coherently driven qubit strongly interacting with its environment show a lower TUR product compared to the weak interaction case for a certain parameter regime. These findings suggest the potential to exploit the strong interacting regime for designing devices with improved precision in heat/energy currents, thereby paving the way for more efficient quantum thermodynamic applications.

#### On the evolution of expected values in open quantum systems
We derive a generalization of the Ehrenfest theorem valid for open quantum systems. From this result, we identify three factors contributing to the evolution of expected values: explicit time dependence of the observable, thermal interaction, and quantum coherence. When considering the local Hamiltonian as the observable, we obtain an alternative version of the first law of thermodynamics. In some cases, the non-thermal contributions to the energy rate of change can be expressed as the expected value of a Hermitian operator, so the power performed by the system can be considered a quantum observable. As an application, the pure dephasing process is reinterpreted from this perspective.

#### Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic run time advantage for all algorithms
 We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer. They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. 
 They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones.  In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these requirements.

#### Quantum Thermodynamics of Continuous Measurement and Feedback
Quantum coherence plays an important role in thermodynamics of quantum systems, in particular under measurement and feedback. Recently, a novel Quantum Fokker Planck Master Equation (QFPME) has been derived for systems under continuous measurement and feedback [1]. This formalism captures the joint time-evolution of a system and a detector with finite bandwidth. Starting from the QFPME, we derive expressions for work, heat, and measurement-induced energy changes, providing insight into the thermodynamics of continuous feedback protocols under finite bandwidth. We illustrate our results on a feedback-controlled coherently driven qubit, which implements a continuous version of a discrete measurement-driven engine [2]. Our work provides a novel approach to investigating the thermodynamics of continuously measured and controlled quantum systems under experimentally relevant circumstances.

#### Direct entropy measurements in electronic nanodevices

Entropy has a unique role amongst thermodynamic variables in the connection it provides between the macroscopic averaged quantities, such as volume, temperature, or magnetisation, and microscopic dynamics. This connection is particularly informative and powerful in small systems with few degrees of freedom, in which the value of entropy allows one to deduce their internal dynamics, such as energy level structures and degeneracies, number of localisation sites and quantum effects. 
However, as the size of a system decreases, the standard approach to measuring entropy, based on heat flows and its thermodynamic definition dS=dQ/T, becomes progressively more unfeasible, as it requires measuring microscopic heat flows. In order to solve this problem, in recent years several alternative methods have been proposed for measuring entropy in nanodevices, utilising electrical measurements: those of charge state[1] or charge transport[2,3]. 
The entropy measurement approach — finding the absolute values of entropy differences between the charge states and deducing the dynamics from them, offers a novel and powerful tool of exploring quantum states and has been used in a wide variety of nanoscale systems[3-6], from single molecules to exotic quasiparticles. We give a overview of electronic entropy measurement methods from a theoretical viewpoint and show that they can be incorporated within a single thermodynamic framework for treating nanoscale systems exchanging particles with thermal baths[7], as well as a brief report on the current state of experiments in the field[8]. 
Direct electronic measurements of thermodynamic parameters offer a pathway to harnessing the well-developed experimental techniques of nanoelectronics for studying quantum thermodynamics. Molecular devices have the potential to be pivotal for this application, due to the endless possibilities of engineering their qualities to enhance particular effects, such as entanglement, high spin values, multiple localisation points, interference paths, or electron-mechanical coupling. Finally, we discuss our plans for the future, as well as open questions standing in the path of its realisation.

#### Topological quantum thermometry
An optimal local quantum thermometer [L. Correa, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 220405 (2015)] has a particular energy level structure with a single ground state and highly degenerated excited states manifold, with an energy gap proportional to the estimated temperature. We show [A. K. Srivastava, et.al., arXiv:2311.14524] that such a spectrum can be engineered in a system of spinless fermions confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice described by the experimentally realizable topological Rice-Mele model at specific lattice fillings, resulting in a close-to-optimal sensitivity of the system to the temperature changes. We characterize the system’s sensitivity to temperature changes in terms of quantum Fisher information. We also study the thermalisation dynamics of the proposed topological thermometer coupled with another quantum many-body system.

#### General theory for correlated quantum engines
As engines keep decreasing in size, out-of-equilibrium regimes and the correlations created while operating in those regimes can no longer be neglected. In this work, first we derive general and exact first and second laws of thermodynamic for completely arbitrary cyclic quantum engines, whithout any assumption on their size or composition, that take into account genuine nonequilibrium effects as well as classical and quantum correlations, and combine them to compute their efficiency. And second, we show that the same quantum engine can operate in two very different regimes: a thermal one, which is the most usual regime, in which work is extracted from the heat flowing between working substance and reservoirs, and an athermal one, in which work is extracted from correlations and out-of-equilibrium states. Finally, we show simulations that support our findings and extend these results to general quantum machines.

#### A quantum Otto engine with shortcuts to thermalization and adiabaticity
We investigate the energetic advantage of accelerating a quantum harmonic oscillator Otto engine by use of shortcuts to adiabaticity (for the expansion and compression strokes) and to equilibrium (for the hot isochore), by means of counter-diabatic (CD) driving. By comparing various protocols with and without CD driving, we find that, applying both type of shortcuts leads to enhanced power and efficiency even after the driving costs are taken into account. The hybrid protocol not only retains its advantage in the limit cycle, but also recovers engine functionality (i.e. a positive power output) in parameter regimes where an uncontrolled, finite-time Otto cycle fails. We show that controlling three strokes of the cycle leads to an overall improvement of the performance metrics compared with controlling only the two adiabatic strokes. Moreover, we numerically calculate the limit cycle behavior of the engine and show that the engines with accelerated isochoric and adiabatic strokes display a superior power output in this mode of operation.

Quantumness can be regarded as a resource available for various tasks. To realize the large-scale quantum information processing, it is essential to utilize such resources even under noisy environments.
This research explores the effect the random noise gives to the quantum resource. We formalize the noisy channel using an ancillary system and a random unitary. The probability distribution of quantum coherence after passing through the random channel is derived based on the random matrix theory, and the distribution is verified by the numerical experiments.

#### Criteria for useful autonomous quantum-thermodynamic machines
Quantum thermodynamicists have been designing quantum machines for decades, and experimentalists have realized such machines recently. Examples include engines, refrigerators, clocks, and batteries. These machines offer fundamental insights but are impractical: running the devices usually requires substantial control and energy. Autonomous quantum machines offer hope for practicality. They operate without time-dependent external control, extracting free energy from, e.g., temperature gradients in their environments. Autonomous quantum refrigerators have recently been realized with trapped ions and superconducting qubits, and one was competitive with previous state-of-the-art cooling protocols. Motivated by the recent surge in autonomous quantum machines, we propose to give the subfield direction. In the spirit of making quantum thermodynamics practical, we posit criteria analogous to DiVincenzo’s criteria for quantum computing. We expect these criteria to be necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines. We illustrate the criteria with diverse machines and diverse platforms (Rydberg atoms, superconducting qubits, trapped ions, molecules, etc.). The criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful quantum thermal machines.

#### Measuring Landauer’s principle in a quantum field simulator
Landauer's principle establishes a bridge between information theory and thermodynamics, by fundamentally relating the erasure of a single bit of information to a minimum amount of heat dissipation. While extensively explored in the context of small quantum systems, extending this principle to complex quantum many-body systems is essential for understanding equilibration, with thermodynamics emerging as an effective coarse-grained description. This talk aims to present the first experimental measurement of Landauer’s principle in a quantum field simulator consisting of two coupled one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose gases. We characterized entropy production along a global mass quench, decomposing it into its information-theoretic contributions using mutual information and relative entropy. Additionally, we may briefly discuss theoretical work on the quantum thermodynamics of local quantum quenches in the many-body domain.

#### Estimation of Hamiltonian parameters from thermal states
We upper- and lower-bound the optimal precision with which one can estimate an unknown
Hamiltonian parameter via measurements of Gibbs thermal states with a known temperature. The bounds depend on the uncertainty in the Hamiltonian term that contains the parameter and on the term’s degree of noncommutativity with the full Hamiltonian: higher uncertainty and commuting operators lead to better precision. We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that decreases faster than 1/√n, beating the standard quantum limit. This result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g. a component of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to n qubit sensors. In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint estimations of multiple parameters. In this
setting, we recover the high-temperature sample scaling derived previously via techniques based on quantum state discrimination and coding theory. In an application, we show that noncommuting conserved quantities hinder the estimation of chemical potentials

#### Monitored non-adiabatic and coherent-controlled quantum unital Otto heat engines: First four cumulants
Recently, measurement-based quantum thermal machines have drawn more attention in the field of quantum thermodynamics. However, the previous results on quantum Otto heat engines were either limited to special unital and non-unital channels in the bath stages, or a specific driving protocol at the work strokes and assuming the cycle being time-reversal symmetric i.e. V†=U (or V=U). In this paper, we consider a single spin-1/2 quantum Otto heat engine, by first replacing one of the heat baths by an arbitrary unital channel and then we give the exact analytical expression of the characteristic function from which all the cumulants of heat and work emerge. We prove that under the effect of monitoring, ν2>ν1 is a necessary condition for positive work, either for a symmetric or asymmetric-driven Otto cycle. Furthermore, going beyond the average we show that the ratio of the fluctuations of work and heat is lower and upper-bounded when the system is working as a heat engine. However, differently from the previous results in the literature, we consider the third and fourth cumulants as well. It is shown that the ratio of the third (fourth) cumulants of work and heat is not upper-bounded by unity nor lower-bounded by the third (fourth) power of the efficiency, as is the case for the ratio of fluctuations. Finally, we consider applying a specific unital map that plays the role of a heat bath in a coherently superposed, manner and we show the role of the initial coherence of the control qubit on efficiency, on the average work and its relative fluctuations.

#### Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems
Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.

#### Quantum thermodynamics with a single superconducting vortex
We introduce the Single Vortex Box (SVB) – a nanodevice that allows to treat a single superconducting vortex as a macroscopic, albeit quantized “particle”, which can be created and annihilated with pulses of electrical current [1,2]. Using the method of fast nanosecond resolving switching thermometry [3], we measure the temperature rise and the subsequent thermal relaxation resulting from the expulsion of just a single magnetic field vortex out of the SVB. Our experiment provides a calorimetric estimation of the dissipation in a superconductor due to a single moving vortex. This is a feat of the fundamental importance that has never been accomplished before for the lack of appropriate tools. Our pioneering demonstration is also a pivotal step towards the development of the vortex electronics i.e. memory cells, superconducting diodes, and logical elements.

#### Role of a Canonical Hamiltonian in the Non-Markovian Quantum Thermodynamics of the Central Spin Model under Strong Coupling
We provide the exact dynamics of a central spin interacting uniformly with a spin bath and derive the canonical Hamiltonian that dictates its dynamics. We study the thermodynamic quantities, particularly entropy production, heat, work, and the change in the internal energy of this model in the strong coupling regime. The maximum work that can be extracted from the system is studied using ergotropy. Further, we explore the role of the canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the thermodynamic quantities in the strong coupling regime. This analysis provides a general picture of the strong coupling non-Markovian quantum thermodynamics.

#### Cooling by heating of a trapped ion using sunlight
Laser cooling typically uses carefully tuned lasers to couple atoms to a near-vacuum optical mode of the electromagnetic field, allowing them to be cooled by spontaneous emission into that mode. When this coupling is controlled by the occupation of another mode, cooling can sometimes be performed by heating that mode, known as ‘cooling by heating’. An experimentally accessible implementation is resolved-sideband cooling, a commonly used technique to cool trapped ions to their motional ground state (corresponding to microkelvin temperatures). While this scheme typically uses a coherent, narrowband laser to drive the cooling, we propose using unfiltered sunlight instead as a demonstration of cooling by heating. We measure the spectrum of sunlight coupled into single mode optical fiber for delivery to the ion, compare it to the spectrum of a blackbody in quasi-one dimension, and provide estimates of the achievable cooling rate with typical experimental parameters. Finally, we discuss and demonstrate a related scheme for cooling the internal states of the ion using sunlight, an example of internal cooling by heating.

#### On the Precise Link Between Energy and Information
We present a modified version of the Szilard engine, demonstrating that an explicit measurement procedure is entirely unnecessary for its operation. By considering our modified engine, we are able to provide a new interpretation of Landauer’s original argument for the cost of erasure. From this view, we demonstrate that a reset operation is strictly impossible in a dynamical system with only conservative forces. Then, we prove that approaching a reset yields an unavoidable instability at the reset point. Finally, we present an original proof of Landauer’s principle that is completely independent from the Second Law of thermodynamics.

#### Scaling relations for finite-time first-order phase transition
The theory of equilibrium phase transition, which traditionally does not involve time evolution, concerns only static quantities. In recent decades, owing to the development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, there is a growing interest in nonequilibrium phase transition which concerns time evolution. It is well-known that in the absence of phase transitions, the excess work resulted from finite-rate quench is proportional to the quench rate $v$. The time evolution in a second-order phase transition can be understood via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the scaling of work is related to the critical exponents. Nevertheless, the finite-time nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the first-order phase transition remains largely unexplored. We investigate the scaling relations of some thermodynamic quantities with the quench rate in the first-order phase transition. It is shown that the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ for small quench rate. Moreover, the delay time and the transition time scale as $v^{-1/3}$. Our study deepens the understanding about the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the first-order phase transition.

#### Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Thermodynamics
In the past years, machine learning applications in the field of quantum physics and quantum technologies have surged along various directions. For instance, it has been used for quantum state tomography, quantum state representation, to approximate quantum dynamics, and to design quantum optics experiments. However, its applications within quantum thermodynamics are still limited and its full potential has not yet been explored.

In this presentation we discuss how reinforcement learning - a branch of machine learning - provides a flexible and powerful framework for a variety of optimal control problems related to non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics. After reviewing the general framework, we showcase its flexibility in two different contexts: first, we consider driven quantum heat engines and refrigerators, discovering finite-time and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic cycles that maximize the power [1] or, more in general, that are Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between power, efficiency and power fluctuations [2]. We then apply our method in the context of quantum batteries, discovering finite-time charging protocols that maximize the ergotropy (i.e. the extractable energy) in the Dicke quantum battery model, finding a collective advantage and optimizing up to 20 qubits [3]. In all cases, the discovered protocols outperform previous proposals made in literature.

We conclude highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning for direct applications to experimental devices [4] - without knowing the details model describing the device - and for measurement and feedback applications in quantum thermodynamics, such as to implement a Maxwell's demon [5].

#### Quantum work statistics at strong reservoir coupling
Determining the statistics of work done on a quantum system while strongly coupled to a reservoir is a formidable task, requiring the calculation of the full eigenspectrum of the combined system and reservoir. Here we show that this issue can be circumvented by using a polaron transformation that maps the system into a new frame where weak-coupling theory can be applied. Crucially, this polaron approach reproduces the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem, thus ensuring consistency with the laws of stochastic thermodynamics. We apply our formalism to a system driven across the Landau-Zener transition, where we identify clear signatures in the work distribution arising from a non-negligible coupling to the environment. Our results provide a new method for studying the stochastic thermodynamics of driven quantum systems beyond Markovian, weak-coupling regimes.

#### Information bounds on randomness-based phase transitions
Information theory, rooted in computer science, and many-body physics have traditionally been studied as (almost) independent fields. Only recently has this paradigm started to shift, with many-body physics being studied and characterized using tools developed in information theory. In our work, we bring a new perspective on this connection, and study phase transitions in models with randomness, such as localization in disordered systems or random quantum circuit transitions. Utilizing information-based arguments regarding probability distribution differentiation, we bound the critical exponents in such phase transitions, extending the Harris bound. We apply the method to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in random quantum circuits. So far, analytical results were only obtained for transitions described by the zeroth Renyi entropy in one-dimensional circuits with Haar-random gates, by a mapping of the problem to the percolation problem in one dimension. Our results are relevant for general circuit dimension, gate combination, and entanglement measures while remaining consistent with the existing result. Finally, we study many-body localization systems in real and Fock space, finding discrepancies in previous results that have not been pointed to before.

#### Thermodynamics of an Entangled Photon Gas in an Engine Cycle
The photon gas is an extensively-studied and well-understood model with a variety of
applications such as describing blackbody radiation or as the working medium for a heat
engine. However, it is unclear whether quantum correlations in the photon gas would notably
affect the behavior of the engine, which raises the question of if one could create a heat engine that exploits genuinely quantum information by using a photon gas comprised of entangled photon pairs. If such a gas is used as the working medium, it may be possible to exploit the quantum correlations in the gas as a resource. The results obtained for thermodynamic cycles with a gas of entangled photon pairs will be presented, whilst juxtaposing them with those of the traditional photon gas.

#### Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation
Accurately modelling macroscopic reservoirs in open systems theory is crucial to resolve thermodynamic effects that arise at a finite temperature, beyond the linear response and outside of the weak coupling regime. In the mesoscopic-leads formulation, macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. The system together with the finite number of lead modes is referred to as the extended system. To access the time-resolved full distribution of integrated thermodynamic currents, such as heat and entropy production, for systems with a quadratic Hamiltonian, we employ a trajectory-unraveling technique on the GKSL master equation governing the dynamics of the covariance matrix of the extended system. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time Landauer erasure.

#### Master equation constructions for probing many-body environments
It has been shown that open systems in contact with many-body environments at criticality exhibit strictly Markovian dynamics. At first glance, this appears to be a contradiction since quantum phase transitions are typically associated with a zero spectral gap or a diverging timescale, whereas open quantum systems typically exhibit Markovian evolution in the presence of fast environments [the adiabatic elimination regime]. Using perturbative open system descriptions, such as quantum master equation (QME), to describe dissipation in the presence of long-range bath correlations seems like a non-starter. In this work, we show this is possible by developing both Markovian and non-Markovian master equation descriptions for a single qubit interacting with a reservoir of free fermions. We show a quantitative agreement between QME predictions and exact dynamics, both at and away from criticality. Our construction demonstrates how standard tools for studying open system dynamics can be deployed to probe many-body criticality and correlated reservoirs.

#### Strong-Coupling Quantum Thermodynamics for Lattice Gauge Theories
Gauge theories underpin our best models of nature’s fundamental interactions, yet their open-system quantum thermodynamics remains largely unexplored. Lattice Hamiltonian formulations of these theories are most naturally suited to quantum simulations. However, calculations with such formulations must be restricted to a certain subspace of the total Hilbert space. This restriction can engender significant interactions between the two constituents - a system and a reservoir - of a bipartite system. We address these interactions using strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics. To model lattice gauge theories undergoing sudden quenches, we present a framework for defining thermodynamic quantities for a system strongly coupled to a reservoir. We have culled three definitions of the system’s internal energy from literature, and these definitions lead to three distinct definitions of work and heat for sudden quench processes. We test the validity of the second law of thermodynamics under the different work and heat definitions. Only two of the work (and so heat) definitions satisfy the second law, we find. Using a thermodynamically consistent framework, we calculate the work and heat exchanged during a quench of a one-dimensional lattice gauge theory. Work and heat, we discover, signal a phase transition in this gauge theory. After bridging lattice gauge theories and open-system quantum thermodynamics, we tie in a concept from quantum information to provide a potential path toward experimental calculations of thermodynamic quantities.

#### Thermodynamic Overfitting and Generalization: Energetic Limits on Predictive Complexity
Efficiently harvesting thermodynamic resources requires a precise understanding of their structure. This becomes explicit through the lens of information engines---thermodynamic engines that use information as fuel. Maximizing the work harvested using available information is a form of physically-instantiated machine learning that drives information engines to develop complex predictive memory to store an environment's temporal correlations.  We show that an information engine's complex predictive memory poses both energetic benefits and risks. While increasing memory facilitates detection of hidden patterns in an environment, it also opens the possibility of thermodynamic overfitting, where the engine dissipates additional energy in testing. To address overfitting, we introduce thermodynamic regularizers that incur a cost to engine complexity in training due to the physical constraints on the information engine. We demonstrate that regularized thermodynamic machine learning generalizes effectively. In particular, the physical constraints from which regularizers are derived improve the performance of learned predictive models. This suggests that the laws of physics jointly create the conditions for emergent complexity and predictive intelligence.

#### Quantum Mpemba effect in a trapped-ion quantum simulator
The non-equilibrium physics of many-body quantum systems harbor various unconventional phenomena. In recent studies on thermalization following quantum quenches on specific states an interesting and puzzling phenomena has emerged -- the quantum Mpemba effect. In this effect, following a quantum quench, an initially tilted ferromagnet restores its symmetry more rapidly when it is farther from a symmetric state compared to when it is closer. In this talk I will present the first experimental evidence of this effect in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. The symmetry breaking and restoration are monitored through entanglement asymmetry, probed via randomized measurements, and postprocessed using the classical shadows technique. Furthermore, a direct comparison between the late time thermal symmetric theoretical state and the experimental state offer direct evidence of subsystem thermalization.

#### Transitionless quantum dynamics in interacting qubits
Driving quantum systems in finite time causes transitions between instantaneous eigenstates. To counteract these often undesirable excitations, shortcuts to adiabaticty have proven themselves to be powerful and effective. In particular, counterdiabatic driving suppresses all excitations away from the adiabatic manifold at all instants. In our work, we apply this strategy to a system of two coupled qubits, in which only one is driven by an external field. This is the simplest example of systems with interacting qubits, which are only locally perturbed.

#### Quantum Thermodynamic Speed Limit in Information Processing
We generalize the second law of thermodynamics involving the information processing of an autonomous Hamiltonian system in the extended quantum version of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] in more generic scenario that the system, bath and memory are correlated initially. We first propose that the total unitary has to have its partial transpose also be a unitary operator, so that the work source plays a role as a catalyst (See Sec. III). Second, by considering the quantum speed limit of the system and memory, we define an effective quantum speed limit, which we call quantum thermodynamic speed limit (See Eq. (51)), and derived its relation to the Landauer’s bound (See Eq. (56). Focusing on quantum Stein’s lemma, we also elucidate the operational meaning of the quantum thermodynamic speed limit by associating it with quantum hypothesis testing (See Eq. (60)).

which emerges through a mapping of the spins into auxiliary fermionic degrees of freedom. We consider a charging protocol relying on the double quench

#### A study of sufficient condition for anomalous heat transfer between two qubits
Anomalous heat transfer occurs when a locally colder body spontaneously transfers energy to a locally hotter body, on average, without external intervention. This seemingly violates the second law of thermodynamics unless the effect of the correlation between the two bodies is considered. Recent studies reveal that reducing pre-existing correlation, quantified by mutual information, is a necessary condition for this phenomenon. However, this alone is insufficient. In this study, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for anomalous heat transfer between two qubits. Our findings indicate a more precise necessary condition: such transfer requires a decrease in quantum correlation, as classical correlation alone cannot induce it. Additionally, we introduce a new quantity capable of accurately determining the direction of heat transfer in both normal and anomalous cases.

####  Filling an empty Aubry-Andre-Harper lattice by local injection of quantum particles
In this work, our objective is to investigate the response of a quasiperiodic system's dynamics when coupled with an environment, contrasting it with the isolated quantum dynamics of the system. We study the dynamics of filling an empty Aubre-Andre-Harper lattice (in different phases of the lattice) by connecting it locally with a thermal bath that injects non-interacting bosons or fermions into the lattice. We use exact quantum dynamics to evolve the whole setup and try to investigate various quantities of interest such as spatial density profile and the total number of bosons/fermions in the lattice. We observe that the spatial spread is ballistic, diffusive, and logarithmic in the Delocalized, Critical, and Localized phases respectively and the local occupation eventually settles down owing to equilibration. However, the time scales of equilibration vary differently in different regimes. We also observe the same scaling in different phases when the system's dynamics are evolved using the Lindblad Equation. The difference between bosons and fermions shows up in the early time growth rate and the saturation values of the profile.

You would like to transform that state to some other state that fulfills some desired property, e.g., a certain ground state population value. To do so you are allowed to bring in another finite dimensional quantum system in some other state \sigma and you may act upon
the joint system via a global unitary. This can be thought of as a concrete modeling of the
desired transformation. Now you may additionally want your transformation to be optimal with respect to the minimization of some cost function, e.g., the average energy change of the joint system. While this sets the stage for a sensible and thermodynamically highly relevant optimisation problem, at first sight it seems to be a hopelessly difficult one to solve: in the above example the target, the ground state population, as well as the cost function, the global average energy change, have a non-linear dependency in the variable to be optimized upon, the unitary.

In this work we solve the above problem for arbitrary finite dimensional systems as well as for any cost and target function that can both be expressed as a linear combination of the probabilities over the outcomes of the same single projective measurement. In our working example the measurement is carried in the energy Eigenbasis.

Our solution delivers an optimal trajectory that can be written purely in terms of a succession of (partial) swaps, i.e. two dimensional unitaries. In order to implement the desired transformation one therefore only needs to continuously move along the optimal trajectory until the desired target value is attained. What is more, even if you change your mind about the choice of target value by stopping before or after the original value is achieved, or do so because you cannot measure or resolve said target value perfectly, our protocol guarantees to deliver an optimal state for the updated target value too, whatever that updated value is.
In addition to drastically simplifying the original problem by only having to choose the optimal unitary among the set of swaps rather than among any global unitary, we also give a cooking recipe for how to construct the optimal trajectory that only scales linearly with the global system dimension rather than quadratically.


Our findings can be interpreted as a sharpening of the second law as well as of the finite resource version of Landauer’s principle: not only do we provide lower bounds on the changes of certain quantities such as entropy or energy for some transformation to occur, we also give concrete protocols achieving these bounds. Zooming out, our results help us get a better grasp at what it takes to carry out a transformation under some energy constraints and allows getting some insights into questions such as how complex does an auxiliary system have to be in order to get a state with this desired property if only a limited amount of energy is at hand? Furthermore, while we have focused here on the task of cooling, our solution applies equally well to other thermodynamically relevant tasks such as the charging of quantum batteries or work extraction.

#### Quantum Darwinism meets Quantum Demons – Emergence of Classical Reality in a Complex Universe
Quantum Darwinism provides a framework to understand how a fundamentally quantum world can support an emergent classical and objective reality. It is however not currently known what properties a general Hamiltonian describing a system interacting with some environment must have to support classicality, only for specific cases such as qubit models. In this talk, I will present our results concerning the criteria necessary for the emergence of quantum Darwinism in a broadly-applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system with a collection of arbitrary finite-dimensional environment degrees of freedom. We consider general two-body system-environment interaction Hamiltonians with or without time dependence. The wide applicability of our results will be a useful tool to guide analyses of quantum-to-classical transitions in a variety of contexts, for instance in minimal models of Maxwell’s demon or other thermodynamic models.

#### Preparing thermal states on noiseless and noisy programmable quantum processors
Thermal (Gibbs) states are important for the study of thermal equilibrium and quantum thermodynamics. Although the simulation of Gibbs states for quantum Hamiltonians is challenging for classical computers, the advent of quantum computing offers new possibilities for their preparation using quantum circuits. While many methods for Gibbs state sampling have been proposed recently, they often suffer from noise sensitivity and typically require fault-tolerance. I will explore a few algorithms that may be more practical. The first algorithm exploits the ergodicity of the target Hamiltonian, as given by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, and shows promise for efficiency on quantum computers for some Hamiltonians. The second algorithm provides a universal approach, but requires exponential running time. Both algorithms incorporate an error mitigation strategy that may prove amenable to today's noisy quantum hardware.

#### Partitioning Quantum Work: Missing Term Revealed in the Thermodynamics of Open Quantum Systems
A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under which entropy is non-singular is based on a partition of Hilbert-space, which assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the environment. However, quantum work partitions non-trivially under Hilbert-space partition, and we derive a Work Sum Rule that accounts for quantum work at a distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. The thermodynamics of two classes of quasi-statically driven open quantum systems is analyzed: systems with a finite environment in the grand canonical ensemble, and systems with an unbounded environment. Our results are illustrated with applications to a time-dependent two-level system and the driven resonant-level model.

#### Newton’s Second Law Revisited: Accounting for Resistance in Applied Forces.
This article traces the historical evolution of applied force equation from its origins with Aristotle to the widespread recognition of Sir Isaac Newton's foundational equation, 'F=ma'. The contributions of influential figures such as John Philoponus, Avicenna, and John Buridan are explored, highlighting the progression of our understanding of applied forces over time. The central insight of this study revolves around the conventional equation 'F=ma', which, while fundamental, lacks the consideration of resistance forces encountered in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, it overlooks the differentiation between applied force and the rate of applied force. This paper aims to explain the terms 'applied force' and 'rate of applied force,' considering both the force applied to an object and any opposing resistance forces it experiences. The proposed equation emphasizes that it not only causes acceleration but must also overcome resistance forces to achieve that acceleration. This equation offers a more complete model for practical scenarios. Additionally, the suggested method for measuring resistance forces adds to its real-world utility. It highlights how science continually evolves to better describe the complexities of the physical world.

#### Quantum geometry and bounds on dissipation in slowly driven quantum systems
We show that the dissipation of energy in quasi-adiabatically driven quantum systems weakly coupled to a heat bath admits a description in terms of trajectories on a manifold characterized by the quantum geometry of the problem. For two-level systems, this description involves the quantum metric, further implying a connection between energy dissipation and the Berry curvature. As a consequence, we demonstrate that in systems slowly driven by a two-tone incommensurate drive, the dissipation rate has a lower bound proportional to an integer describing topological energy conversion between the two tones (provided certain symmetry conditions are respected). These results provide a design principle towards developing optimal driving protocols.

#### Quantum-enhanced photoprotection in neuroprotein architectures of quantum emitters in thermal environments
Superradiance is the phenomenon of many identical quantum systems absorbing and/or emitting photons collectively at a higher rate than any one system can individually. This phenomenon has been studied analytically in idealized distributions of electronic two-level systems (TLSs), each with a ground and excited state, as well as numerically in realistic photosynthetic nanotubes and cytoskeletal architectures. Superradiant effects are studied here in realistic biological mega-networks of tryptophan (Trp) molecules, which are strongly fluorescent amino acids found in many proteins. Each Trp molecule acts as a chromophore absorbing in the ultraviolet spectrum and can be treated approximately as a TLS, with its $1L_a$ excited singlet state; thus, organized Trp networks can exhibit superradiance. Such networks are found, for example, in microtubules, actin filaments, and amyloid fibrils. Microtubules and actin filaments are spiral-cylindrical protein polymers that play significant biological roles as primary constituents of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, while amyloid fibrils have been targeted in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. We treat these proteinaceous Trp networks as open quantum systems, using a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to describe interactions of the chromophore network with the electromagnetic field. We numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian to obtain its complex eigenvalues, where the real part is the energy and the imaginary part is its associated enhancement rate. We find that all three of these structures exhibit highly superradiant states near the low-energy portion of the spectrum, which enhances the magnitude and robustness of the quantum yield to static disorder and thermal noise. The high quantum yield and stable superradiant states in these biological architectures may play a photoprotective role in vivo, downconverting highly energetic ultraviolet photons emitted from reactive free radical species and thereby mitigating biochemical stress and photophysical damage. Contrary to conventional assumptions that quantum effects cannot survive in large biosystems at high temperatures, our results suggest that macropolymeric collectives of TLSs in microtubules, actin filaments, and amyloid fibrils exhibit increasingly observable and robust effects with increasing length, up to the micron scale, due to quantum coherent interactions in the single-photon limit. Superradiant enhancement and high quantum yield exhibited in neuroprotein polymers could thus play a crucial role in information processing in the brain, the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and related dementias, and a wide array of other pathologies characterized by anomalous protein aggregates.

#### Symmetry shapes thermodynamics of macroscopic quantum systems
Symmetries play a fundamental role in shaping physical theories, from quantum mechanics to thermodynamics. Studying the entropic, energetic, or dynamic signatures of underlying symmetries in quantum systems is an active field of research, from fundamental questions about entropy scalings, ground state properties, or thermalization, to the optimization of quantum computing or numerical simulation procedures, and is gaining momentum due to
rapid experimental advances, particularly in cold atoms [1].

In this work [2], we derive a systematic approach to the thermodynamics of quantum systems based on the underlying symmetry groups. We show that the entropy of a system can be described in terms of group-theoretical quantities that are largely independent of the details of its density matrix. We apply our technique to generic N identical interacting d-level quantum systems. Using permutation invariance, we find that, for large N , the entropy displays a universal large deviation behavior with a rate function s(x) that is completely independent of the microscopic details of the model, but depends only on the size of the irreducible representations of the permutation group. In turn, the partition function is shown to satisfy a large deviation principle with a free energy f (x) = e(x) − s(x)/β, where e(x) is a rate function that only depends on the ground state energy of particular subspaces determined by group representation theory. We demonstrate the power of our approach by
applying it to the nontrivial task of describing phase transitions governed by the interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in the transverse-field Curie-Weiss model.

#### Measuring Landauer’s principle in a quantum field simulator
Landauer's principle establishes a bridge between information theory and thermodynamics, by fundamentally relating the erasure of a single bit of information to a minimum amount of heat dissipation. While extensively explored in the context of small quantum systems, extending this principle to complex quantum many-body systems is essential for understanding equilibration, with thermodynamics emerging as an effective coarse-grained description. This talk aims to present the first experimental measurement of Landauer’s principle in a quantum field simulator consisting of two coupled one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose gases. We characterized entropy production along a global mass quench, decomposing it into its information-theoretic contributions using mutual information and relative entropy. Additionally, we may briefly discuss theoretical work on the quantum thermodynamics of local quantum quenches in the many-body domain.

#### Efficient Quantum Work Reservoirs at the Nanoscale
When reformulated as a resource theory, thermodynamics can analyze system behaviors in the single-shot regime. In this, the work required to implement state transitions is bounded by $\alpha$-Renyi divergences and so differs in identifying efficient operations compared to stochastic thermodynamics. Thus, a detailed understanding of the difference between stochastic thermodynamics and resource-theoretic thermodynamics is needed. To this end, we study reversibility in the single-shot regime, generalizing the two-level work reservoirs used there to multi-level work reservoirs. This achieves reversibility in any transition in the single-shot regime. Building on this, we systematically explore multi-level work reservoirs in the nondissipation regime with and without catalysts. The resource-theoretic results show that two-level work reservoirs undershoot Landauer's bound, misleadingly implying energy dissipation during computation. In contrast, we demonstrate that multi-level work reservoirs achieve Landauer's bound and produce zero entropy.
